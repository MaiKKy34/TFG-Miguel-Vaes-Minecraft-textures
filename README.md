# Texture Generation with Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Final Degree Project Miguel
This project focuses on training an artificial intelligence model, specifically a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), to generate textures for video games. The objective is to leverage extensive knowledge of neural networks and the generative model VAE to create a robust texture generation system. The videogame choosen in this project is Minecraft but the code is useful for other textures by just changing the data set the model is trained with.

## Features

- Implement the VAE using Python programming language.
- Use the power of PyTorch and torchvision libraries for neural network implementation.
- Train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model for texture generation.
- Generate textures and skins specifically tailored for the Minecraft video game.
- Integrate the generated textures into Minecraft for real-time observation and evaluation.
- Provide a diverse range of textures and skins due to Minecraft's wide selection.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset of textures and skins used for training the VAE.
- `models/`: Includes the implementation of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions and helper modules used throughout the project.
- `generated_textures/`: Holds the generated textures and skins as output of the VAE.
- `integration/`: Contains integration scripts to seamlessly incorporate generated textures into Minecraft.
